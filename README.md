## Build 

In working directory, run following command : 
```sh
make
```

## Test

After build the project, there will be two types of test available in the working directory,
`schema_test` and `encoding_test`.

`schema_test` is for testing whether this project data structure store nested schema properly, so if we traverse the data structure, it tests whether all the schema's element which is traversed is identical(and the order of element too.) to the original schema's. Also, this work designs metadata to support variant integer type, so that 

`encoding_test` is the testing for proper encoding and decoding.
In order to do so, I choose a method to encode a nested schema first, and with the bytestream(output of the encoding), decode that bytestream and encode the schema which is decoded. (I.e., encode -> decode -> encode) So that we can compare the first bytestream which is the output of encoding the original schema, and output of the decoded schema's encoded bytestream. Those two generated bytestream should be identical. 

Those tests are implemented by using `googletest`.
